# Chicken Farming Game 🐔

Welcome to the **Chicken Farming Game**! Embark on an exciting journey where you can own virtual chickens, watch them lay EGGS tokens daily, and join a thriving community of virtual farmers.

## 🌐 **Overview**

In the Chicken Farming Game:

- **EGGS** are ERC20 tokens that can be minted by your chickens daily or acquired from other players.
- **Chickens** are ERC721 tokens (NFTs) that can be created by converting an EGGS token and paying an additional fee in ETH.

## 🚀 **How It Works**

1. **Acquire a Chicken**: 
   - To get a chicken, you'll need 1 EGGS token and 10 SMR. 
   - By burning your EGGS token and paying the fee, you mint a chicken NFT.
   
2. **Chickens Lay EGGS**: 
   - Each of your chickens can lay 1 EGGS token every day! 
   - This mimics the natural process of chickens laying eggs. 
   - Make sure you claim your EGGS daily.
   
3. **Life of a Chicken**: 
   - Every chicken NFT has a random lifespan between 10 to 20 days. 
   - After its life is over, the chicken will no longer produce EGGS tokens. 
   - So make sure you optimize your strategy!
   
4. **Stake your EGGS**: 
   - EGGS tokens can be staked. 
   - All the SMR fees collected from creating new chickens are shared among the stakers. 
   - The more you stake, the more rewards you potentially get.

## 📜 **Rules**

- **Minting Chickens**: You can mint a chicken NFT by burning 1 EGGS token and paying a 10 SMR fee.
- **Egg Laying**: Each chicken lays 1 EGGS token per day. It's up to you to claim it!
- **Chicken Lifespan**: Each chicken has a random lifespan of 10 to 20 days. Once a chicken reaches the end of its lifespan, it won't produce any more EGGS.
- **Staking**: The collected SMR from chicken minting is distributed among the stakers. The more you stake, the more rewards you get.
